**Gracidea** is a cartographic project which aims to gather all known *Pokémon* regions into a single 2D map, keeping fidelity games while taking the liberty of filling blanks and making minor arrangements based on official artworks and anime.

### Features

**Gracidea** is not an ordinary world map! See below a short list of the awesome features embedded in it :

* **Faithful maps** : Maps are based first on core games and then filled with region knowledge and interpretations
* **Wild areas** : *Pokémon* can spawn in wild areas! If you're lucky you may even see rare encounters and shinies!
* **Liveful cities** : Humans and trainers are living along with *Pokémon*s!
* **World map** : A mini map lets you access cities and special locations quickly
* *New features will be implemented at a later date !*

### ![](/client/static/copyrighted/imgs/icons/map.png) Maps

Since there are often map redesigns in *Pokémon* franchise, the following games were chosen to represent each region:
* **Kanto** : *Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen*
* **Hoenn** : *Pokémon Emerald*
* *Others regions will follow at a later date !*

Note that some versions include 3D graphics, so these are interpretations of what they could have been if they were in 2D.

#### Current progress

## ![](/client/static/copyrighted/imgs/icons/contribute.png) Contributing

The *Pokémon* world is huge, and so is the amount of work needed to map it. Wether you want to complete the mapping, provide new sprites or propose new features, please go ahead and open a pull request!

If you're not very talented apart from knowing your type advantages, you can always report bugs and innacuracies in issues!

#### Additional notes

* You can fork this repo, but if you're making a feature which could be integrated in the [original repo](https://github.com/lowlighter/gracidea), you're encouraged to submit a pull request so everyone can enjoy it !
* Note however that this is only a mapping project, not a game project. Thus, suggestions like adding battles, captures, gym badges, story progression, and other stuff like this will always been rejected.
* Despite *Gracidea* being based on *Pokémon* franchise, its code must be able to be dissociated from it (this is why the code never mentions *Pokémon* directly, except in documentation). This means that in case of legal issues with the usage of the franchise, licensed sprites will be removed from repo but the code can be kept intact.
* The maintainers of this repo cannot be held responsible of the usage of it from other users.
* **Star** this repo if you like it !

## ![](/client/static/copyrighted/imgs/icons/note.png) Note from the cartographer

I always thought 2D *Pokémon* games had their own charm, and this is what gave birth to this project.
I hope you'll be able to enjoy and (re)discover this marvellous franchise with this extensive map !
